# go-deb
A stuff for creating dep-packages for go-programms.
It was used to my projects, such as [go-nominatim](https://github.com/KristinaEtc/go-nominatim) or [stomp](https://github.com/KristinaEtc/stomp)

##Usage
1. Clone the project to a directory where go-project is situated
2. Create config file with all values (example - make-dev-nominatim.sh) 
4. Run your script, which was created in step 2 <br/ >

Profit!

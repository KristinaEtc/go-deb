# go-deb
A stuff for creating dep-packages for go-programms.
It was created to run my projects, such as [go-nominatim](https://github.com/KristinaEtc/go-nominatim) or [stomp](https://github.com/KristinaEtc/stomp)

##Usage
1. Copy directory to a go-project folder
2. In `make-dev.sh` set all your needed values
3. Don't forget to change init config according to your needs
4. Run `make-dev.sh`
